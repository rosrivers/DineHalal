After class, she wants to grab a quick meal but struggles to find **verified halal options**. Google and Yelp list restaurants as ‚Äúhalal,‚Äù but many aren‚Äôt actually **certified**.

No more **second-guessing**. With DineHalal, finding **authentic halal food** is simple, reliable, and stress-free.

   - Select the "Dine Halal" target
   - Go to "Build Phases"
   - Expand "Copy Bundle Resources"
   - Click the "+" button
